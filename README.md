# interplanetary_game
Official repository for versions of the game Interplanetary, written in Python 3.7

This project was started on September 2, 2018.

This game was created to imagine the idea of discovering new star systems more closely than by observation with telescopes from Earth.

The game already includes several features, including the following commands:

"move" - allows travel between the 16 different sectors in cardinal directions (up, down, left, and right)

WARNING: If you attempt to move to a sector in a way that wouldn't make sense given the map, the game will crash.

"examine" - reveals characteristics about the currently occupied sector

"puzzle" - checks whether a puzzle can be solved in the currently occupied sector

"solve" - checks if a sector's puzzle can be solved, then prompts for the sector key conditionally

"loot" -  loots sector for a random number of credits (currently can only be done once, but a repuation system may be added in the future)

"money" - prints the current number of credits owned by the player
