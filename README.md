# interplanetary_game
Official repository for versions of the game Interplanetary, written in Python 3.7

This project was started on September 2, 2018.

This game was created to imagine the idea of discovering new star systems more closely than by observation with telescopes from Earth.

The game already includes several features, including the following commands:

"move" - allows travel between the 16 different sectors in cardinal directions (up, down, left, and right)
"examine" - reveals characteristics about the currently occupied sector
"puzzle" - checks whether a puzzle can be solved in the currently occupied sector
